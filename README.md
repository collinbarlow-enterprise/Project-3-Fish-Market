# <strong><em> Oceanic Lux : Procuring the Finest Fish in the Sea  </em></strong>

***

## Oceanic Lux Overview

Welcome to the finest e-commerce procurement site for all your fishy needs! On this site, you are able to browse our catalog of <em>fish</em>, view specific details on each fish, add/remove said fish to your cart, view past orders, and delete past orders (because no one needs to know your fishy dealings).

The data is pulled through Danny Yu's API which is connected to the FishWatch API. This API is used to seed our database.
